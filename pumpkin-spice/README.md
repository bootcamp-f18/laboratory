# Instructions

In this experiment, we use Sass to customize the
color palette in Bootstrap.

We installed Sass, Browser-sync, and Bootstrap locally
instead of using the repo's modules.

We created an index.html files with examples of
Bootstrap code that used all the color classes (primary,
success, warning, danger, info).

Then we created a Sass file (main.scss), set Bootstrap's
color variables, and imported Bootstrap.

Then we compiled main.scss into output.css so that we
could see the results of our changes.
